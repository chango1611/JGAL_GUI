				Is proposed to minimize the value returned by the function:
			</p>
			
			<p><tt>
				Sum(x_i^2);<br>
				Where x_i is in the range [-512,512)<br>
				And i goes from 0 to 19
			</tt></p>
			
			<p>
				First is defined the chromosome genes in Define Genes,
				as they all share the same configuration can be used the Add Many option.
				For this, you should create the gene configuration, as shown in the figure.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then you should press Add Many,
				opening a popup window that asks how many genes to add;
				as 20 genes are needed, you should write 20.
				By pressing accept, the window should look like the following figure.
			</p>

			<p>
				Following this, close the window to define genes and continues to build the fitness function,
				which should be observed similar to that shown in the figure below.

				Press accept and continue to choose the Selector,
				since for this example there is no plan to use termination condition.
				It was decided to use the tournament selector with tournament size 2.
			</p>

			<p>
				Press accept and continue to choose the Operators.
				It was decided to use Uniform Crossover and Classic Mutation.
			</p>

			<p>
				It continue to place the remaining parameters.
				Was decided to place 50 to the population size and 100 to the maximum number of generations.

				Finally, the algorithm must be run selecting minimization as optimization type to be used.
				After successfully running the GA, will display a results window as shown in the figure.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was obtained as better fitness of the population 15,795.
				The average of the last generation fitness was 37,278, while the average total was 218,400.
				Finally, it is noted in the chart that the GA acted as expected (At higher generation a best fitness).
