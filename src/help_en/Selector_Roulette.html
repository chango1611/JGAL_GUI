			<p>
				The Roulette selector is considered the classic selector.
				Consists of "spinning" a roulette as many times as the number of chromosomes in the population (pop_size).
			</p>

			<p>
				Each wheel space represents a chromosome of the population,
				so every time the roulette is spinned, a chromosome is selected to be part of the new population.
			</p>

			<p>
				Roulette selector is based on giving larger spaces to chromosomes with higher fitness and
				smaller space to lower fitness chromosomes.
				This way, chromosomes with greater aptitude will have a greater probability of being selected into the next generation.
