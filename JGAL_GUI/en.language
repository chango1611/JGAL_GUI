Errors:
The variable has not name
The names must be unique for each variable
The variables must follow the format for an identifier.
Starts with an alphabetic character or underscore, followed by 0 or more alphanumeric characters or underscore.
The range [
) only allows one value
The alleles can't be empty strings
The alleles must be unique for this gene
There must be at least two alleles for this gene
Min and Max must be characters
The file doesn't exist or it doesn't follows the format
The genes must be defined before making a validation for the fitness function
The return is not the same type as the expected one
Function Error in the location:
Is not possible to run the Genetic Algorthm because:
Genes not defined
Fitness Function not Valid
Termination not Valid
Selector not defined
Operators not defined
Parameters not defined
It's not possible to show the results, execute the Genetic Algorithm first
